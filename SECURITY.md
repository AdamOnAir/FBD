## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report vulnerabilities, go to ISSUE section, post it. You can also post to benchspark.dev/fbd/bug

## FTP 
As everyone has access to the FTP server, everyone can delete, modify and add. In that case, you don't have the right to modify, read, access the /www and / branches.
If someone is caught modifying or reding those branches, he will automatically be banned and the AUTH password changed.

## Additionnal Notes
For the moment, there is no Server and Client for chatting. So, all versions are supported.
