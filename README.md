Note that all the code was written using QB64, and we'd want to have GoLand License.

## Jetbrains OSS
Hello, JetBrains. I(We) updated our GitHub project, so does that makes us eligible for the OSS ? Thank you. Actually, we will need dotUltimate, Clion, and GoLand.

## Installation
Download from github with the Code > Download Zip button or with local git.

## Usage

Open qb64 and the file, and hit f5. Or, use the .exe Futurely, it will be compiled for MacOS, and Linux.

## Our plans
We will integrate a textual Web Browser, a Text/Code editor based on commands like Vi/Vim, improve the chat system and deploy it to a real server, create an FTP Server specially for FBD, and a micro-blogging textuall app. All that, in different technologies. (We will try to make it as lightweight as possible)
