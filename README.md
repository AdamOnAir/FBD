## Charm_

A special thanks to all members of [Charm_ team](https://charm.sh/), for developing Gum, and helping me debug `fbd.sh` and probably other code. A big big thanks.
To Community : Please, use Pop for sending and receiving mails, best client. Use gum for your Shell scripts, Mods for AI, VHS for recording Terminal (used for FBD demo) and Soft-Serve for launcing git server. Really useful, boosted my productivity, and terminal loving.
