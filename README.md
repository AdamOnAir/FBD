# FBD

FBD is a textual software in Shell or Hell(as ya want, pal) and mainly for Arch (BTW). So read jokes, and read news through txt files. huh.

<br>Made with NanoðŸ˜Ž and Arch.

## Compile
Arch-Based :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FBDev64/FBD && cd FBD
sh ./setup.sh
./src/fbd.sh
```
Non-Arch :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FBDev64/FBD && cd FBD
chmod 777 ./src/fbd.sh
./src/fbd.sh
```

The only dependency is Gum. You need it in order to run FBD correctly, else you'll get an error. Download it with brew or your package manager. If you are on Arch Based, just execute the Script, it will download it with Pacman.
