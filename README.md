Note that all the code was written using QB64, and we'd want to have GoLand License.

## Jetbrains OSS
You declined all my requests, so I'll use Vim(best editor).

## Installation
[Releases](https://github.com/FBDev64/FBD/releases) or by compiling.

## Compiling

For Linux users : git clone, and
`
makepkg -si
`

## Our plans
We will integrate a textual Web Browser, a Text/Code editor based on commands like Vi/Vim, improve the chat system and deploy it to a real server, create an FTP Server specially for FBD, a micro-blogging textuall app, and an Academy, to learn to code in C, Makefile, Qbasic, Shell, Python, Rust, Assembly. Small learning projects will be included!. All that, in different technologies. (We will try to make it as lightweight as possible). Also, a file explorer and a better FTP Client are in development.
